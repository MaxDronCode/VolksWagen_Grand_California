# Overview
Volkswagen Grand California is an educational project based on Kotlin, aimed at practicing modular programming, code documentation, and becoming familiar with the GitHub environment, in the Catalan language.

# Project Description
This application assumes that you are a user of a Volkswagen Grand California and offers to calculate its price when you want to sell it as a used vehicle. The application utilizes various functions to determine the final price, such as the vehicle's mileage, tire wear, whether it has a bike rack, etc. In the end, the program will advise you on how much money it recommends listing it for in the used car market and provides a breakdown of the calculations performed.

The application relies on a file of functions to display various interaction [menus](src/main/kotlin/functionsMenu.kt) with the user, a file for all functions related to price calculation, and another file with more generic functions related to the purpose of the application. Additionally, two support files are includedâ€”one that provides quick and simple functions for coloring console output, and another support file with useful functions for keyboard input, data validation, etc.
