# Project Description
This application assumes that you are a user of a Volkswagen Grand California and offers to calculate its price when you want to sell it as a used vehicle. The application utilizes various functions to determine the final price, such as the vehicle's mileage, tire wear, whether it has a bike rack, etc. In the end, the program will advise you on how much money it recommends listing it for in the used car market and provides a breakdown of the calculations performed.

The application relies on a file of functions to display various interaction [menus](/src/main/kotlin/functionsMenu.kt) with the user, a file for all functions related to [price calculation](/src/main/kotlin/functionsCalculate.kt), and another file with more [generic functions](/src/main/kotlin/functionsVW.kt) related to the purpose of the application. Additionally, two support files are includedâ€”one that provides quick and simple functions for [coloring](/src/main/kotlin/ConsoleColors.kt) console output, and another support file with [useful functions](/src/main/kotlin/Utilities.kt) for keyboard input, data validation, etc.

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd your-project
   ```
2. **Compile the Project:**
   ```bash
   kotlinc -include-runtime -d your-project.jar src/main/kotlin/*.kt
   ```
3. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   java -jar your-project.jar
   ```
- Another option is to import the repository into your favorite IDE. For optimal import and execution, it is recommended to use IntelliJ with Gradle

## Thank You for Exploring!

I hope you enjoyed exploring this project as much as I did creating it. Throughout this journey, I've become more acquainted with the GitHub environment and mastered various Git commands. I've refined my understanding of modular programming concepts and embraced Kdoc, a widely recognized industry standard for code documentation.

Looking forward to our paths crossing again in future, in more intricate projects.

Happy coding!
